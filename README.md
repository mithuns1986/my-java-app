## Maven Build Lifecycle

The Maven build lifecycle is a fundamental concept that defines the sequence of phases and goals executed to build and manage a Maven project. Understanding the build lifecycle is crucial for efficiently managing the build process, from compilation to deployment. The Maven Build life cycle includes a lot of build phases to complete the build process in the Maven.

## Types Of Maven Build Lifecycle
default: This is the main lifecycle, as it's responsible for project deployment.
clean: Handles project cleaning, ensuring that all artifacts generated by previous builds are removed.
site: Manages the creation of the project's site documentation.
Each lifecycle consists of a sequence of phases. Each phase represents a stage in the lifecycle, and executing a phase will trigger the execution of all preceding phases. Below we provide information about each phase in the maven build build life cycle.

## Maven Build Workflow
Below is a typical Maven build workflow for the default lifecycle.

Validate Phase: Check the project configuration and validate if all information required is present.
Compile Phase: Compile the source code of the project.
Test Phase: Execute unit tests using a testing framework.
Package Phase: Bundle the compiled code into a JAR/WAR file.
Verify Phase: Perform checks on the packaged code.
Install Phase: Install the package to the local repository for use as a dependency in other projects locally.
Deploy Phase: Deploy the package to a remote repository for sharing with other developers.
